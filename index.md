### Welcome!
My name is Miles D. Williams. I am a political science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This site is a working summary of my latest research and analysis. My interests encompass a wide variety of subfields and research questions, and my toolbox of methods is always expanding. See the below for summaries of recent projects. To see all of my projects, check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15). Below you will also find a copy of my CV.
