### Welcome!
I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu/). I also serve as a methods specialist for the [Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov/), housed in the U.S. General Services Administration in Washington, D.C. My primary research agenda focuses on strategic foreign policymaking among countries in the context of foreign aid. I further have several secondary research projects that include the study of foreign aid to countries experiencing civil war, Chinese media coverage of foreign aid recipients, links between aid recipient governance and aid fragmentation, international migration as both determinant and consequence of international aid policy, and the role of religion in politics. I also have an interest in causal inference, computational methods, and game theory.

### Software
In conjunction with my project on [random forest adjustment](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/Leveraging-the-Black-Box/blob/master/draft1.pdf), I've developed an R package called "RFA" that provides easy-to-use tools for implementing the method. The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/RFA).

I further am developing an R package with tools necessary to estimate a "Strategic Autoregressive Model," useful for estimating free-riding or competitive behavior among a set of actors. The method is based on the work of Martin Steinwand---his paper describing the method in *Political Analysis* can be found [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/estimating-freeriding-behavior-the-stratam-model/0CBD6176E53848732CEC2C151A491212). The "SARM" package that I have developed estimates a modified version of the model proposed by Steinwand. The latest version of the package and additional details can be found [here](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/SARM).
