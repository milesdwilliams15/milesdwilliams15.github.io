## Welcome! <img src="logo.png" align="right" height="130" style = "border-radius:0px"/>
Welcome to my academic website. My name is Miles Williams and I am a Ph.D. candidate studying International Relations at the Department of Political Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu/). I also serve as an Associate Fellow specializing in methods with the [Federal Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov/). My research lies at the intersection of international political economy, methodology, and policy evaluation. In my dissertation, I study strategic interdependence among industrialized countries as they target foreign aid to the developing world. I consider how the foreign policy interests donor governments promote through their aid allocation shape *when* and *where* they compete or pass the buck in supplying economic assistance. To address this issue, I rely on various tools, from formal theory, to machine learning as well as classical econometric techniques. You can click on the **About** tab above learn about my broader research agendas, software, and teaching.
