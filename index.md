## Welcome! <img src="logo.png" align="right" height="130" style = "border-radius:0px"/>
Welcome to my academic website. My name is Miles Williams and I am a Ph.D. candidate studying International Relations at the Department of Political Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu/). I also serve as an Associate Fellow specializing in methods with the federal [Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov/). My primary research agenda centers on the political economy of foreign aid. In my dissertation, I study aid giving as an arena of foreign policy competition among donor governments and use game theory, classic econometrics, and machine learning to bring greater understanding to how the foreign policy interests donor governments promote through their aid allocation shape how they respond to the aid allocations of one another. Beyond foreign aid, I have a general interest in methodology. I have supported numerous experimental, quasi-experimental, and descriptive evaluations for the federal government; applied text-as-data methods to religious political communication; and am actively developing novel methods and statistical packages.
