## About Me <img src="logo.png" align="right" height="130" style = "border-radius:0px"/>
My name is Miles Williams and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu/). I also serve as an Associate Fellow specializing in methods with the federal [Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov/). I am interested in international relations, political economy, statistical methods, and causal inference. My primary research centers on identifying the foreign policy goals that motivate countries to give foreign aid, and I have a number of ongoing projects related to this theme. In my dissertation, I use game theory, classic econometrics, and machine learning to shed light on how foreign aid allocation serves as an arena of both strategic competition and buck-passing among donor governments.

My research has appeared in a range of outlets, including peer-reviewed journals, book chapters, and online articles. In addition to studying foreign aid, I have supported numerous experimental, quasi-experimental, and descriptive evaluations for the federal government related to public finance and vaccination uptake. I also have collaborated on projects that apply text-as-data methods to religious political communication, and I actively maintain a research agenda centered on developing methods that rely on novel applications of machine learning for causal inference or that build on model-based approaches to testing theoretical models.
