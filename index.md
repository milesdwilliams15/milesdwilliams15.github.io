# Welcome!
I am a Ph.D. candidate studying International Relations in the Political Science Department at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu/). I also currently serve as a methods specialist for the [Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov/team/miles-williams/), housed in the U.S. General Services Administration in Washington, D.C. My primary research agenda centers on the political economy of foreign aid. In my dissertation, I study how the foreign policy goals countries pursue through their foreign aid allocations explain their strategic responses to each other as they allocate economic assistance to developing countries. To address these issues, I rely on various tools, from formal theory, to machine learning as well as classical econometric techniques. 

In addition to my dissertation, I maintain a number of research agendas. I'm interested broadly in the determinants and impacts of foreign aid allocation by leading and emerging donor countries. In one project, I study how industrialized country interests in maintaining trade and in minimizing unwanted migration differently affect how they target aid in developing countries experiencing civil war and those at peace. In collaboration with a colleague, we ask whether coverage of countries in Chinese media influence where Chinese officials target economic assistance, or whether China's foreign aid allocations dictate coverage of aid recipients. I'm also interested in the politics of multilateral development institutions, specifically with respect to how organizations like the World Bank balance pressure to bend to the interests of its most influential donors and its mandate to target its loans and grants to the most deserving recipients. I also have applied text-as-data methods to the issue of political communication in religion in collaboration with Ryan Burge at Eastern Illinois University.

I further maintain a research agenda centered on developing new methods for identifying causal estimates with observational data. In one ongoing project, I propose a novel application of random forests to the problem of regression adjustment. In another project, I build upon an existing model-based approach to estimating a "strategic autoregressive model" (StratAM). I currently have R packages in development for each of these methods.

### R Packages

  - [`RFA`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/RFA) - Implements [random forest adjustment](https://rpubs.com/milesdwilliams15/rfa-vignette) (RFA). RFA is a method for partialing out the influence of confoudning covariates via random forests.
  - [`seerrr`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/seerrr) - Tools that simplify the process of doing computational power analysis.
  - [`SARM`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/SARM) - For estimating a modified version of the Strategic Autoregressive Model developed by [Steinwand (2011)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/estimating-freeriding-behavior-the-stratam-model/0CBD6176E53848732CEC2C151A491212).
  - `oesr` (available soon, with Ryan T. Moore) - For visualizing the results from randomized controlled trials using the Office of Evluation Sciences' [recommended style guide](https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/reporting-statistical-results.pdf).
