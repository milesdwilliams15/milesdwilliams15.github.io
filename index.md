### Welcome!
I am a Ph.D. candidate studying International Relations in the Political Science Department at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu/). I also currently serve as a methods specialist for the [Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov/team/miles-williams/), housed in the U.S. General Services Administration in Washington, D.C. My dissertation explores how bilateral foreign aid allocation---a tool in service of wide-ranging foreign policy interests---reflects a mutual best response among leading countries as they pursue their foreign policy interests vis-a-vis each other. My broader research includes understanding the consequences of ongoing civil war as a determinant of aid allocation, how China (an increasingly consequential foreign aid donor) frames its foreign aid program to domestic and foreign audiences, studying the links between aid recipient governance and aid fragmentation, international migration as both determinant and consequence of international aid policy, and the role of religion in politics. I also have an interest in causal inference, computational methods, and game theory.

### R Packages

  - [`RFA`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/RFA) - Implements [random forest adjustment](https://rpubs.com/milesdwilliams15/rfa-vignette) (RFA). RFA is a method for partialing out the influence of confoudning covariates via random forests.
  - [`seerrr`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/seerrr) - Tools that simplify the process of doing computational power analysis.
  - [`SARM`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/SARM) - For estimating a modified version of the Strategic Autoregressive Model developed by [Steinwand (2011)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/estimating-freeriding-behavior-the-stratam-model/0CBD6176E53848732CEC2C151A491212).
  - `oesr` (available soon, with Ryan T. Moore) - For visualizing the results from randomized controlled trials using the Office of Evluation Sciences' [recommended style guide](https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/reporting-statistical-results.pdf).
