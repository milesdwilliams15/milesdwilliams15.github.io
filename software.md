As a part of my methodologically oriented research agenda, I have developed a number of R statistical packages. Click on the links below to learn more.

<ul>
  <li><a href = "https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/RFA">RFA</a> - Implements <a href = "https://rpubs.com/milesdwilliams15/rfa-vignette">random forest adjustment</a> (RFA). RFA is a method for partialing out the influence of confoudning covariates via random forests.</li>
  <li><a href = "https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/seerrr">seerrr</a> - Tools that simplify the process of doing computational power analysis.</li>
  <li><a href = "https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/SARM">SARM</a> - For estimating a modified version of the Strategic Autoregressive Model developed by <a href = "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/estimating-freeriding-behavior-the-stratam-model/0CBD6176E53848732CEC2C151A491212">Steinwand (2011)</a>.</li>
  <li>oesr (available soon, with Ryan T. Moore) - For visualizing the results from randomized controlled trials using the Office of Evluation Sciences' <a href = "https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/reporting-statistical-results.pdf">recommended style guide</a>.</li>
</ul>
