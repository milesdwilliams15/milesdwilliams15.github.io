In this second installment on DAGs and confounding, I’m cheating,
*slightly*. The name *D*irected *A*cyclic *G*raph implies no *cycles*
and unidirectional causal paths in a set of causal relationships.
However, in many settings, we may encounter forms of confounding that
are indeed cyclical and multidirectional. I’m referring specifically to
simultaneity bias—a form of endogeneity introduced through mutual
causation of two or more variables.

In this post I want to briefly walk through a connonical example (at
least a Google search would suggest it is as much), how to illustrate it
via a DAG-like framework (remember these won’t be true DAGs since the
causal relations violate the *D* and *A* parts of the acronym), and a
simulation to illustrate the bias it introduces and how we can get
around it.

## What is simultaneity bias?

There are many forms of endogeneity that may exist in data. One such
form is simultaneity—a scenario where two outcomes are mutually causal.
Such a scenario is depicted in the figure below.

![](/assets/images/2021-03-12/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

We have two endogenous outcomes of interest, *y*<sub>1</sub> and
*y*<sub>2</sub>. These are a function of a set of observed exogenous
outcomes, *x*<sub>1</sub> and *x*<sub>2</sub> respectively, and some
unobserved exogenous variables, *u*<sub>1</sub> and *u*<sub>2</sub>.

Within a regression framework, such an instance can be represented as a
structural equation. For example:

*y*<sub>1</sub> = *α*<sub>1</sub>*y*<sub>2</sub> + *α*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *u*<sub>1</sub>,

*y*<sub>2</sub> = *β*<sub>1</sub>*y*<sub>1</sub> + *β*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *u*<sub>2</sub>,

where *y*<sub>1</sub> and *y*<sub>2</sub> are the endogenous outcomes,
*x*<sub>1</sub> and *x*<sub>2</sub> are exogenous predictors, and
*u*<sub>1</sub> and *u*<sub>2</sub> are unobserved predictors—and thus
random noise.

Under only very restrictive assumptions can we reliably estimate such a
system of equations using OLS. If *α*<sub>1</sub> and *β*<sub>1</sub>
are non-zero—as they would be if *y*<sub>1</sub> and *y*<sub>2</sub> are
endogenous—OLS estimates will be biased and inefficient. The reason for
this can be seen by expressing these equations in reduced form. For
example, for *y*<sub>1</sub>:

*y*<sub>1</sub> = *α*<sub>1</sub>*y*<sub>2</sub> + *α*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *u*<sub>1</sub>,

*y*<sub>1</sub> = *α*<sub>1</sub>(*β*<sub>1</sub>*y*<sub>1</sub> + *β*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *u*<sub>2</sub>) + *α*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *u*<sub>1</sub>,

*y*<sub>1</sub>(1 − *α*<sub>1</sub>*β*<sub>1</sub>) = *α*<sub>1</sub>*β*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *α*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *α*<sub>1</sub>*u*<sub>2</sub> + *u*<sub>1</sub>,

*y*<sub>1</sub> = *π*<sub>1</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *π*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *v*<sub>1</sub>,

where the reduced form parameters are nonlinear functions of the
structural parameters:

*π*<sub>1</sub> = *α*<sub>1</sub>*β*<sub>2</sub>/(1 − *α*<sub>1</sub>*β*<sub>1</sub>);

*π*<sub>2</sub> = *α*<sub>2</sub>/(1 − *α*<sub>1</sub>*β*<sub>1</sub>);

*v*<sub>1</sub> = (*α*<sub>1</sub>*u*<sub>2</sub> + *u*<sub>1</sub>)/(1 − *α*<sub>1</sub>*β*<sub>1</sub>).

There is a similar reduced form equation for *y*<sub>2</sub>. We’ll
denote it as:

*y*<sub>2</sub> = *γ*<sub>1</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *γ*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *v*<sub>2</sub>.

From this formulation we can see in the construction of the new error
terms *v*<sub>1</sub> and *v*<sub>2</sub> that *y*<sub>1</sub> will be
correlated with the error term through *y*<sub>1</sub>’s correlation
with *u*<sub>2</sub>—and *y*<sub>2</sub> will be correlated with the
error term through its correlation with *u*<sub>1</sub>. This is
problematic for the estimation of the structural equations via OLS
because it means that in estimating the regression for *y*<sub>1</sub>,
the unobserved variation captured by *u*<sub>1</sub> confounds the
relationship between *y*<sub>1</sub> and *y*<sub>2</sub>—the same is
true for *u*<sub>2</sub> in the second regression equation.

The below figure illustrates for clarity. Though it was not immediately
apparent in the first figure, the causal relationships it represents
imply the confounding captured in this one.

Because *u*<sub>1</sub> and *u*<sub>2</sub> are unobserved, we cannot
control for them in order to reliably estimate the effect of
*y*<sub>1</sub> on *y*<sub>2</sub>, and vice versa. However, it is
possible to reliably estimate the reduced form equations since the error
terms are not correlated with the exogenous predictors *x*<sub>1</sub>
and *x*<sub>2</sub>. This is illustrated by the next figure below and
can be leveraged to recover unbiased estimates of the causal
relationships between the endogenous outcomes.

To demonstrate, I’ve simulated a data generating process as follows
using tools from the `seerrr` package, with the structural parameters
defined each as 1/2:

``` r
# Structural parameters:
a1 <- 0.5
a2 <- 0.5
b1 <- 0.5
b2 <- 0.5

# Reduced form:
p1 <- (a1 * b1) / (1 - a1 * b1)
p2 <- a2 / (1 - a1 * b1)
q1 <- (b1 * a1) / (1 - b1 * a1)
q2 <- a1 / (1 - b1 * a1)

# Simulate the d.g.p.
simulate(
  u1 = rnorm(N),
  u2 = rnorm(N),
  x1 = rnorm(N),
  x2 = rnorm(N),
  y1 = p1 * x2 + p2 * x1 + (a1 * u2 + u1) / (1 - a1 * b1),
  y2 = q1 * x1 + q2 * x2 + (a2 * u1 + u2) / (1 - b1 * a1)
) -> sim_dat
```

By default, this generates a list of 200 datasets drawn from the data
generating process where *N* = 500. Using multiple draws from the d.g.p.
in this way allows us to get a sense for how generally reliable
estimates of the parameters are. Because we’re dealing with random
variables, some variation in performance from sample to sample is
expected.

With these draws, I estimate a distribution of OLS estimates for the
reduced form equations:

``` r
estimate(
  sim_dat,
  y1 ~ x2 + x1,
  c("x1", "x2"),
  se_type = "stata"
) -> red1
estimate(
  sim_dat,
  y2 ~ x1 + x2,
  c("x1", "x2"),
  se_type = "stata"
) -> red2
```

And for the structural equations:

``` r
estimate(
  sim_dat,
  y1 ~ y2 + x1,
  c("y2", "x1"),
  se_type = "stata"
) -> str1
estimate(
  sim_dat,
  y2 ~ y1 + x2,
  c("y1", "x2"),
  se_type = "stata"
) -> str2
```

Next, I evaluate the bias in the reduced form estimates:

``` r
bind_rows(
  evaluate(
    red1 %>% filter(term == "x2"), 
    what = "bias", 
    truth = p1
  ) %>% mutate(param = "pi[1]"),
  evaluate(
    red1 %>% filter(term == "x1"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = p2
  ) %>% mutate(param = "pi[2]")
) -> red_bias1
bind_rows(
  evaluate(
    red2 %>% filter(term == "x1"), 
    what = "bias", 
    truth = q1
  ) %>% mutate(param = "gamma[1]"),
  evaluate(
    red2 %>% filter(term == "x2"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = q2
  ) %>% mutate(param = "gamma[2]")
) -> red_bias2
```

And for the structural equation estimates:

``` r
bind_rows(
  evaluate(
    str1 %>% filter(term == "y2"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = a1
  ) %>% mutate(param = "alpha[1]"),
  evaluate(
    str1 %>% filter(term == "x1"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = a2
  ) %>% mutate(param = "alpha[2]")
) -> str_bias1
bind_rows(
  evaluate(
    str2 %>% filter(term == "y1"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = b1
  ) %>% mutate(param = "beta[1]"),
  evaluate(
    str2 %>% filter(term == "x2"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = b2
  ) %>% mutate(param = "beta[2]")
) -> str_bias2
```

The below figure shows the results for each of the parameters. The
absolute average bias is given along the x-axis and the relevant
parameter is indicated along the y-axis. If the point estimate is closer
to zero the closer the average estimate is to its true value. By this
metric, the systematic bias in the structural parameter estimates is
quite evident.

## What can be done?

Clearly the reduced form specification is more consistent. However, in
practice the reduced form estimates, while reliable, are not as
informative as we would like. More often the structural parameters are
of greatest theoretical interest. So how can we reliably recover these?

One option is an instrumental variables (IV) approach. This is usually
done via two-stage least squares (TSLS). This entails using the reduced
form equations in a first-stage regression for each of the outcomes,
then using the fitted outcomes from the reduced form equations as
predictors in the structural equations in the second stage. E.g.:

-   Stage 1—estimate the reduced form equations:

*y*<sub>1</sub> = *π*<sub>1</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *π*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *v*<sub>1</sub>,

*y*<sub>2</sub> = *γ*<sub>1</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *γ*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *v*<sub>2</sub>.

-   Stage 2—use predictions from stage 1 as regressors in stage 2:

*y*<sub>1</sub> = *α*<sub>1</sub>*ŷ*<sub>2</sub> + *α*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>1</sub> + *u*<sub>1</sub>,

*y*<sub>2</sub> = *β*<sub>1</sub>*ŷ*<sub>1</sub> + *β*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sub>2</sub> + *u*<sub>2</sub>.

This approach works for generating reliable estimates of the structural
parameters in the second stage because the fitted values of
*y*<sub>1</sub> and *y*<sub>2</sub> on the right-hand side of the
equations are no longer correlated with the error terms. This removes
the unobserved confounding captured by *u*<sub>1</sub> and
*u*<sub>2</sub>.

I first apply the IV approach on our simulated data:

``` r
estimate(
  sim_dat,
  y1 ~ y2 + x1 | x2 + x1,
  c("y2", "x1"),
  se_type = "stata",
  estimator = iv_robust
) -> tsls1
estimate(
  sim_dat,
  y2 ~ y1 + x2 | x2 + x1,
  c("y1", "x2"),
  se_type = "stata",
  estimator = iv_robust
) -> tsls2
```

I then calculate average bias:

``` r
bind_rows(
  evaluate(
    tsls1 %>% filter(term == "y2"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = a1
  ) %>% mutate(param = "alpha[1]"),
  evaluate(
    tsls1 %>% filter(term == "x1"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = a2
  ) %>% mutate(param = "alpha[2]")
) -> tsls_bias1
bind_rows(
  evaluate(
    tsls2 %>% filter(term == "y1"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = b1
  ) %>% mutate(param = "beta[1]"),
  evaluate(
    tsls2 %>% filter(term == "x2"),
    what = "bias",
    truth = b2
  ) %>% mutate(param = "beta[2]")
) -> tsls_bias2
```

The results are shown below. Again these are depicted relative to the
average bias of the reduced form parameters. Note the difference
relative to before. The estimates of the structural parameters have
substantially reduced bias—practically performing just as well as the
reduced form parameter estimates.
