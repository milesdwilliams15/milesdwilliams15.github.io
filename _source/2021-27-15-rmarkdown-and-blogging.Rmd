I love working with R Markdown. It makes writing articles and putting together instructional materials easy, especially when they include statistical analysis or data visualizations. It turns out, I can use R Markdown to write blog posts, too.

I stumbled onto a helpful post by [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/08/two-helpful-rmarkdown-jekyll-tips/) from 2019 that provides a nice summary of how to do this. I wanted to see how it worked myself, so I tried it out in writing this post.

To make it work I simply created a `_source` directory in the RStudio project I use for my website. In that directory, I created and saved a .Rmd file for this particular post. At the top of that file, I specified the YAML as follows:

The key to making this work is modifying the file path for `knit`. Usually, when knitting a .Rmd file to an html or pdf the knitted version is stored in the same working directory as the raw .Rmd file. I never put together that one could customize where to store the knitted version. For sites hosted by Jekyll (like mine), blog posts go in a `_posts` directory. So, by specifying:


    knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) {
      rmarkdown::render(inputFile, encoding = encoding, output_dir = "../_posts") })


I can keep the raw .Rmd file in one directory so that the only files stored in the `_posts` directory are the actual blog posts I want to publish on my site.

Then, all I need to do is knit the document and push the changes to [GitHub](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/milesdwilliams15.github.io). *Voila*, I have a blog post that also renders output from R code inline just as seamlessly as it would for any other document. 

***But, there is a caveat!*** I had to do two more things to make everything work. First, I needed to set my working directory to the `_source` directory where my .Rmd file lives. Next, I had to update my `setup` code chunk to specify where to pull rendered figures from:

    base_dir <- "~/My Website/milesdwilliams15.github.io/" # i.e. where the jekyll blog is on the hard drive.
    base_url <- "/" 
    fig_path <- "assets/images/" 
    
    knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = base_dir, base.url = base_url)
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig_path,
                          cache.path = '../cache/',
                          message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,
                          cache = TRUE) 

If the above isn't specified, figures produced in R chunks won't appear in the actual blog post because the knitted .md file will contain local file paths to the generated images by default---which is no good, no good at all. 

Once all of that has been sorted out, making blogging with R Markdown work is as simple has pressing "Knit." Everything should render just like it would in a knitted pdf or html. For instance, below is the boilerplate example text and R script you get when you open a .Rmd file in RStudio, with everything rendered just as it should be:


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
