One of the things I love about teaching an introductory course on data visualization in R is the limitless opportunity for developing tools that ease students into otherwise highly technical concepts. On this front, I recently introduced my students to custom color palettes in `{ggplot2}`. As I was brainstorming how best to do so, I quickly realized that I would need to do some hand-holding. 

`{ggplot2}` provides some excellent choices for customizing color palettes, and many packages have been developed to support even greater flexibility in palette customization. But when I considered alternative ways to teach my students, I kept wishing that existing options were more streamlined. Why do there have to be different functions for different aesthetic mappings and for qualitative, sequential, and diverging palettes?

I quickly realized that it would be really easy for my students to get lost in the details, which was a problem. Not only did I worry about unintentionally discouraging them, all I really wanted to do was let students focus their energy on the creative process of identifying their favorite palettes.

So, I quickly cobbled together [some helper functions](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/data-viz-fall-2022/blob/main/palette_helpers.R) that I had students call with the `source()` command. I wrote these functions with the open source and easy to use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website in mind. My students' workflow would be simple: copy urls for Coolors palettes they developed and use a function that sets those palettes globally in their R session. Then, use a single function using the `+ function()` syntax of `{ggplot2}` that, given just a few extra commands, would automatically pick the correct function "under the hood" to implement a certain palette.

This ended up being a pretty successful approach. Students were able to quickly select and implement palettes in class, and, aside from a few bugs I soon realized I'd need to fix, the palette helper functions worked seamlessly in class.

It wasn't long after I introduced these helpers that I realized it might be worthwhile to just write an R package. And, so I did. Inspired by the site I was using to let students select palettes, I named the package [`{coolorrr}`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/coolorrr), and it's available to install from GitHub by writing:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("milesdwilliams15/coolorrr")
```

## Setting Palettes Globally

While the code has been modified and improved since I first introduced it to my students, the overall workflow the package supports is the same. 

1. Set palettes globally;
2. Apply palettes to a `ggplot` object.

Pretty simple stuff.

The first step is done using the `set_palette()` function. It can be used as-is without supplying any commands (be warned, you'll be subjected to my bad taste in colors!):

```{r}
library(coolorrr)
set_palette()
```

Once you've run this function, you'll notice that you now have four new objects in your global environment: `qual`, `dive`, `sequ`, `dual`. Observe:

```{r}
qual
dive
sequ
dual
```

The first is an object containing the hexidecimal codes for a 5 color qualitative palette (more colors could be used if needed). The second is an object containing the same for a diverging palette with a minimum, middle, and maximum color specified. The third is an object containing the same for a sequential palette with the minimum and maximum color specified. The last is a special qualitative palette for when you only have two categories.

Mercifully, you aren't limited to the default selections. You can update any of these four palettes in one of two ways.

First, you can go to [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) and either use the palette generator or any one of the pre-selected trending palettes by copying the url for the specific palette and copying it as a character string in `set_palette()`. For example, say I picked this 10 color (fall themed!) qualitative palette: [https://coolors.co/palette/fabb7d-fb8333-605f64-c0321a-9b6a6c-b78d87-af8066-3f4a5d-999380-8c2c1a](https://coolors.co/palette/fabb7d-fb8333-605f64-c0321a-9b6a6c-b78d87-af8066-3f4a5d-999380-8c2c1a).

To use it, I would write:

```{r}
# coolor url
qual_url <- "https://coolors.co/palette/fabb7d-fb8333-605f64-c0321a-9b6a6c-b78d87-af8066-3f4a5d-999380-8c2c1a"

# set with custom qualitative palette
set_palette(
  qualitative = qual_url
)
```

The `qual` object in the global environment now is:

```{r}
qual
```

Of course, you aren't limited to colors that you can find and palettes you can build at coolors.co. You can use all the standard R colors, too.

Say we wanted a purple based sequential palette. We would write:

```{r}
set_palette(
  sequential = c("white", "purple"),
  from_coolors = FALSE
)
sequ # this updates the sequ object
```

By selecting `FALSE` for `from_coolors`, the function knows that the palette is not coming from coolors.co. This stops it from doing a bunch of stuff under the hood to extract the hexidecimal color codes from the palette relevant Coolors url. If you don't set this command to `FALSE`, you run the risk of getting values that R doesn't understand. Check it out.

```{r}
set_palette(
  sequential = c("white", "purple")
)
sequ
```

The function still runs, but now its doing a bunch of stuff, erroneously, to the vector of colors we've tried to use for the sequential palette. The result is that instead of a vector with the values "white" and "purple" we have a vector with the values "#white" and "#purple" which will create an error if we try to update a sequential palette for `ggplot`.

Now, I know what you're thinking. What if you want to set one palette with colors in R and another with a palette you found or made at coolors.co? You can do that by simultaneously setting `from_coolors = FALSE` and applying a function called `coolors()` to the coolors.co url:

```{r}
# the new color palettes
qual_url <- qual_url <- "https://coolors.co/palette/fabb7d-fb8333-605f64-c0321a-9b6a6c-b78d87-af8066-3f4a5d-999380-8c2c1a"
sequ_vec <- c("white", "purple")

# setting simultaneously
set_palette(
  qualitative = coolors(qual_url),
  sequential = sequ_vec,
  from_coolors = FALSE
)
qual; sequ # check
```

The `coolors()` function is a helper that converts a coolors.co url to a vector of hexidecimal color codes:

```{r}
coolors(qual_url)
```


## Using your palettes

After you've set your palettes, all that remains is to apply them to your ggplots. This is done with the `ggpal()` function. 

This function has three default options, but it can also pass other generic commands to various `{ggplot2}` functions under the hood.

Here's a basic example using `mtcars`. The below script makes a scatter plot with linear regression lines that shows the miles per gallon by weight of various cars. The color aesthetic is used to map point and regression line colors to the number of cylinders per car. To start, the output just uses ggplot's default color palette.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# use mtcars data
p <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(x = wt,
      y = mpg,
      color = as.factor(cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE) 
p # print
```

To use our own palette with `{coolorrr}`, after we've opened the package with a call to `library()`, we just use `set_palette()` to set our custom palettes globally, and then we call them as needed using `ggpal()`. The below script sets the palette using defaults and then applies the qualitative palette for the colors aesthetic.

```{r}
set_palette() # using defaults
p + ggpal()
```

By default, `ggpal()` is set to `ggpal(type = "qualitative", aes = "fill", midpoint = 0)`. Other options for type include `"diverging"`, `"sequential"`, and `"binary"`. The aes command can be either `"color"` or `"fill"`. The midpoint option can be any real valued number (this indicates what midpoint should be used if a diverging palette is called).

If we don't update our type and aes options appropriately, `ggpal()` will fail to update the palette. For example, here's the same example as above, but aes has been mistakenly set to "fill". Note that the output has not been updated.

```{r}
p + ggpal(type = "qualitative", aes = "fill")
```

Here's an example where using the fill aesthetic would be the appropriate choice. To mix things up, let's use that fall-based theme I lifted from coolors.co for the qualitative palette. The below figure shows average miles per gallon by the number of cylinders. It then uses colors to distinguish cars by the number of carburetors.

```{r}
qual_url <- qual_url <- "https://coolors.co/palette/fabb7d-fb8333-605f64-c0321a-9b6a6c-b78d87-af8066-3f4a5d-999380-8c2c1a"
set_palette(
  qualitative = qual_url
)
p <- ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(x = as.factor(cyl),
      y = mpg,
      fill = as.factor(carb)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ggpal(aes = "fill")
p
```

Usage for sequential and diverging palettes is similar. Below is an example of an application of a sequential palette. The code below produces a map of the US showing Hillary Clinton's vote shares in the 2016 US presidential election at the county level. The sequential palette is used to indicate said vote shares.

```{r}
# get county level data and merge
library(socviz)
library(dplyr)
county_full <- left_join(x = county_map,
                         y = county_data,
                         by = "id")

# plot a map of the US showing Clinton's 2016 vote shares
p <- ggplot(county_full) +
  aes(x = long,
      y = lat,
      group = group,
      fill = per_dem_2016) +
  geom_polygon(size = 0.05) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_equal() +
  ggpal(type = "sequential", aes = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Clinton's vote share by county in 2016",
       fill = "Vote Share")
p
```

A diverging palette could also be applied to this data. The below script creates an identical figure to that produced above except that now the diverging palette is called with its midpoint set to 0.5.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(county_full) +
  aes(x = long,
      y = lat,
      group = group,
      fill = per_dem_2016) +
  geom_polygon(size = 0.05) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_equal() +
  ggpal(type = "diverging", aes = "fill", midpoint = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Clinton's vote share by county in 2016",
       fill = "Vote Share")
p
```

A final note about `ggpal()` is that it will also pass any number of other commands to the functions it applies under the hood. For example, when a qualitative palette is used `ggpal()` passes information to one of the `scale_*_manual()` functions. This function allows for adding custom color or fill labels. So does `ggpal()` by extension.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(x = wt,
      y = mpg,
      color = as.factor(cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE) +
  ggpal(labels = c("4 Cyl", "6 Cyl", "8 Cyl")) +
  labs(x = "Weight",
       y = "MPG",
       color = NULL)
p
```

## Conclusion

[`{coolorrr}`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/coolorrr) is not the only R package for incorporating custom palettes with ggplot, but it has some tools that are useful for me. I hope the same is true for others.
