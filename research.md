In addition to my dissertation, I maintain a number of substantive and methodologically oriented research agendas. For the former, my research lies at the 
intersection of foreign policy, foreign aid, and multilateral development institutions. I also have applied text-as-data methods to study political communications 
by religious elites in collaboration with Ryan Burge (Eastern Illinois University). With respect to methods, my research emphasizes innovative applications of machine 
learning for covariate adjustment in observational data and extensions of model-based approaches to testing the empirical implications of theoretical models. 

Below, you'll find a summary of my interests, and of my research...
